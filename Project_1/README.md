# Project 1

This is the repository for the first project in the course Computational Physics (FYS3150), at the University of Oslo (UiO). The project was the result of a collaboration between Einar Skoglund and Emil Kvernevik.

All of the code content used in our project can be found in the **code_scripts**-folder, along with a guide on how to compile and run them. Likewise the corresponding plots for the scripts can be found in the **plots**-folder. Each script is named after the problem where it was used, and the associated plots' name correspond to the task as well (i.e. **problem_7.py** has a plot named **problem7.pdf**).
