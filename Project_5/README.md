This is the repository for the fifth project in the course Computational Physics (FYS3150), at the University of Oslo (UiO). The project was the result of a collaboration between Einar Skoglund and Emil Kvernevik.

All of the code content used in our project can be found in the `codescripts`-folder, along with a guide on how to compile and run them. Further, the corresponding plots for the scripts can be found in the `plots`-folder. The animations, such as the one below, can be found in the `animation`-folder.
